<h1>Annihilate</h1>
<p>
Sergeant Zariah checked his scanner and saw that
Sergeant Sarin and his men were running level in the
parallel corridor. All other corridors were clear, and the
objective lay ahead seemingly undefended. The hulk
contained hundreds of rooms holding Genestealers in
cryogenic storage and it was hard to believe that one
particular set of storage pods was more important than the
others. However, the data the <b>Blood Angels</b> had
downloaded from the hulk's computer indicated that one of
pods held a very special Genestealer, a leader known as a
Patriarch.
</p>
<p>
All the cryogenic clusters the Terminators had seen so far
looked identical: frosted crystal cylinders full of swirling
green gas. It was impossible to see what was inside them,
though the mere presence of a human watcher was
enough to stimulate agitated movement within.
</p>
<p>
It was hoped that the Terminators would be able to identify
which cylinder contained the Genestealer leader. No-one
knew what a Patriarch looked like, it might look just like an
ordinary Stealer but its physiology could be completely
different. There was not enough time to capture the alien
leader for study, even if they could identify it, so their
orders were to destroy the entire contents of the target
room.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Sarin's scanner blipped a furious warning.
Seconds earlier the area had been clear, now numerous
blips were closing in on all sides. It seemed they had
walked into a hornets' nest. His helmet display indicated
they should reach their destination in under two minutes -
with the blessing of the Emperor they might just make it...
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
