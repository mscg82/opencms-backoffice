<h1>Suicide Mission</h1>
<p>
As the blunt nose of the Chapter's boarding craft smashed through the
steel skin of the space hulk, the <i>Intolerance</i> blazed the alien vessel
with a great burst of radiation. The flash of data was quickly
analysed by the onboard computers to give the Imperial forces their
first detailed view of the inner layout of the space hulk. On the dark
green view-screens of the bridge the skeletal passages and chambers glowed
with a ghostly white light. Commander Bellisario pointed to one of the groups
of glowing dots clustered around the outer levels of the hulk.
</p>
<p>
"These match up with the protuberances on the outside of the hulk", he said.
"They appear to be small boarding craft, perhaps escape pods. We cannot risk
any planet-side contamination - no Genestealers can be allowed to escape. It
is imperative that the pods are destroyed or disabled before we launch our
main attack".
</p>
<p>
Within minutes, the next wave of data from the scanners had fleshed out the
three dimensional floorplan of the hulk. Wide spectra analysis revealed a
fine red network of active power conduits, and, more ominously, hundreds of
blobs of cold blue - cryogenics chambers.
</p>
<p>
Computer analysis predicted that the escape pods were all linked to a central
control room situated well beyond the defensive perimiter, in the centre of
several larger, cryogenic clusters. Any squad moving into the area was
unlikely to get out alive, but Commander Bellisario ordered a squad to attack
immediately. The Space Marines could afford to delay no longer...
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines are attempting to deliver a flamer hit on the Launch Control
Room.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Lanarte must deliver a flamer hit to the
Launch Control Room in the south-west.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines lose if the Space Marine carrying the flamer is killed,
or has no flamer shots left.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
There are two blips at the beginning of the mission, with a further blip
arriving every turn. The Blips use any entry area, but may be forced to
lurk for a single turn if a Space Marine is within six floor tiles of the
entry area.
