<h1>SPAWN OF EXECRATION</h1>
<p>
The hulk was spotted by a <b>Space Wolves'</b> scout vessel, doing a routine patrol on
the edge of the area of warp/real space overlap known as the Eye of Terror. The
ship's Astropath broadcast the hulk's location back to the Chapter's home world,
Fenris, from where the information was passed on to Earth. The majority of the
Space Wolves were away, fighting a campaign against Chaos Renegades on the
other side of the Eye of Terror. As one of their companies prepared for
mobilisation, the Space Wolves received a message from the <b>Blood Angels</b> First
Company, who had just arrived at the space hulk. Because of the uncertain nature
of astropathic communication, the <b>Blood Angels</b> had received the Space Wolves'
message two weeks <i>before</i> it had been sent. Once again, fate had led the <b>Blood
Angels</b> into battle with the Genestealers.

Commander Borgia, commander of the <b>Blood Angels'</b> force, named the hulk 'Spawn
of Execration'. The massive ship was so huge it dwarfed the Imperial craft that
gathered round it. The hulk seemed to be a compacted mass of old spaceships and
space debris. Incredibly, scans revealed the thing was powered, and registered
large numbers of life signs. The sheer size and density of the hulk meant the
scanners were unable to penetrate much further than the outermost layers. It would
be logical to assume the life forms were Genestealers, but this close to the Eye of
Terror the presence of other, more sinister, occupants could not be ruled out.

<p>
There was only one way to find out: the <b>Space Marines</b> would have to board the
hulk and investigate. No matter what evils lurked aboard this floating wreck nothing
would be allowed to stand against the might of the <b>Blood Angels</b> Terminators.
