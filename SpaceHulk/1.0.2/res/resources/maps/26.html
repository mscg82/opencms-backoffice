<h1>Race Against Time</h1>
<p>
Sergeant Cicero pounded up the corridor as fast as his
Terminator armour would carry him. Behind him clanked
Brother Galen and Brother Herpestes, lugging their one
remaining heavy flamer. They were down to three now. Two
Space Marines had been killed as they fought their way
down to the heart of the hulk to sabotage the nuclear
reactor; another two had been killed in a tremendous battle
in the room that contained the damping controls.
</p>
<p>
On the way back Brother Speiro had fallen to his doom
when a metal staircase had given way beneath the weight
of his Terminator armour. They had paused momentarily to
reload the flamer and had been ambushed by Stealers
attacking the room from three directions at once. Brother
Malthus had been killed almost instantly as a Genestealer
clawed his suit to shreds. The Space Marines had beaten
off the attack, but Brother Leance had been so badly
wounded that the Sergeant had been forced to administer
the Emperor's Grace to save him from further suffering.
This left three, and they still had several levels to go before
they were close enough to the outer skin of the hulk for the
teleporter to latch onto their life signs.
</p>
<p>
A glance at his scanner showed Cicero that there were not
only blips converging behind them but also blips massing
to block their way ahead. With the luck of the Emperor, if
they could keep going for just a few more minutes they
would be safe. Ominous rumblings deep within the hulk
signalled that the destruction of the damping controls was
having an effect. The walls started to shake, and chunks of
metal and cabling began to fall from the ceiling. "Brother
Herpestes, behind you! Use the flamer!" he yelled.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The remaining Space Marines are attempting to get
to the outer levels of the hulk so that they can be
teleported off before it blows up.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines are trying to get through this sector as quickly as possible. Genestealers are in close pursuit of the fleeing Marines.
At least two of the Marines must leave this sector via the marked exit point before the end of the 12th turn.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Each room in this sector already contains a blip. One more blip per turn will enter the sector.
</p>
<p>
After four turns, the pursuing Genestealers will reach this sector, and an extra blip per turn will enter from <i>behind</i> the Marines.
