<h1>Retribution</h1>
<p>
The campaign to seize the hulk was going remarkably well;
this time the Emperor was smiling on the <b>Blood Angels</b>.
Casualties were less than expected, and every specific
objective had been achieved, the most important being the
retrieval of the information stored in the hulk's computer
banks. The most efficient way to rid the hulk of its
monstrous inhabitants was to use toxic gas to kill the
active Genestealers, then take advantage of the respite to
destroy the cryogenic clusters before the reinforcements
they contained awoke.
</p>
<p>
The Imperial xeno-biologists had refined the anti-Genestealer toxin so that
it was now hundreds of times
more effective than the version used on the <i>Sin of
Damnation</i>, over a hundred years ago. Although deadly, the
toxin would not spread through the hulk on its own. The
data from the computer had provided the answer: the
hulk's internal air pumping systems were still operational
and could be used to pump the toxin through the hulk. The
success of the whole campaign now rested on this one
last mission.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must carry the toxin canisters to
the main air pump and connect them into the air
system.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Lutin and Squad Scipio must attach at least one canister of toxin to the air pump. Any other result is a failure. The two canisters are being carried by the rearmost Marine in each squad.
</p>
<p>
While a Space Marine is carrying a canister, he cannot carry out any action except movement. He cannot fire a weapon, operate doors or properly defend himself in close combat.
</p>
<p>
It costs 1 action point to put a canister down, and 2 action points to pick it up. Canisters cannot be passed directly from one Marine to another.
</p>
<p>
Once a Marine reaches the air pump, it costs 2 action points to attach the canister.
</p>
<p>
Genestealers cannot move or damage the canisters.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Five blips are already in the area. Two extra blips will arrive each turn, starting in turn 2.
