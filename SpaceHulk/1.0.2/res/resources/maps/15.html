<h1>Decoy</h1>
<p>
Time was running out, and the Imperial forces were
completely outnumbered. The squads on the hulk had
suffered heavy casualties, while as many as 35,000
Genestealers still lay in cryogenic slumber. There was one
last tactic open to the <b>Blood Angels</b>: they could flood the
cryogenic chambers with a deadly toxic gas.
</p>
<p>
The information retrieved by the C.A.T. had identified a
cluster of ducts in a room more than four sectors away
from the Space Marine beachhead. These ducts cycled air
round the cryogenic chambers, and were the most efficient
method of distributing the toxic gas. The remaining Space
Marines advanced through extremely light opposition
towards the target area.
</p>
<p>
As they moved it became obvious that a second wave of
Genestealers, much larger than the first, was beginning to
emerge from cryogenic slumber. Surveillance from the
<i>Intolerance</i> assessed this second force as having a
strength of 4,000, while the remaining 30,000 or more
Genestealers were also commencing their recovery cycles.
</p>
<p>
By the time they were within two sectors of the target
room, the Space Marine phalanx was down to only 22 Terminators.
The area around the target room was,
apparently by coincidence, occupied by a relatively strong
enemy force. A frontal assault would be costly and time
consuming. Success seemed to be slipping through the
Blood Angels' grasp.
</p>
<p>
The order was issued to sacrifice almost half of the
remaining Space Marines in a decoy action. If they could
draw enough of the enemy away, the room could easily be
taken, and, if they could keep going long enough, they
would buy precious seconds for the cryogenic attack.
</p>
<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines are attempting to reach a
cryogenics chamber just to the south of the sectors
shown here, both to destroy the several thousand
Genestealers inside it before they wake up, and to
draw off Stealers from the real target of the assault.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Lysand and Squad Parin are attempting to get through this sector alive.
</p>
<p>
The mission is a success if five Space Marines leave the map via the red exit point.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Three blips are already present. Two more blips will arrive each turn.
