<h1>Seize and Secure</h1>
<p>
Sergeant Laertes was another survivor of the <b>Blood 
Angels'</b> fateful encounter with the <i>Spawn of Execration</i>. In
all his years of service, the abortive mission to seize the
space hulk was his most vivid, and most horrific, memory.
He had seen things no ordinary man could ever imagine,
and lived through experiences no normal human could
endure or comprehend. In time, as the years passed, and
memory blurred all the wars and the battles together, his
sense of wonder had dulled, and the extraordinary had
become commonplace. But he had never forgotten the
<b>Blood Angels'</b> struggle against the Genestealers.
</p>
<p>
Every single detail of their battle on the space hulk lay
engraved on his memory. It was a horror he would like to
be able to forget, but couldn't. In his dreams he relived the
fight over and over again. Running through the maze of
claustrophobic corridors and dark rooms. Genestealers
charging at them from all directions: alien killing machines
without fear or conscience. No matter how many Stealers
they killed, more and more had thrown themselves
forward. Ten, fifty, hundreds dead, it made no difference,
the monsters just kept coming in an endless stream.
</p>
<p>
Now he was going to have to face the horror again. If he
could only survive this day, Laertes believed he would
conquer the demons of his own personal fears.
</p>
<p>
Squad Laertes has been charged with securing a
bridgehead on the hulk, a secure area for the rest of the
force to board. Scans had revealed an ideal location but
there were blips approaching from four different directions.
Each of the entry points had bulkheads, and it was their
mission to secure the section by sealing shut the doors.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
There are bulkheads at all the entry points to this sector, and the
Space Marines must seal them.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Laertes and Squad Tycho must seal all four entry points. They can claim a draw if they seal three.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Four blips are already moving in this sector. Two more blips will arrive as long as there are at least three available entry points. This will be reduced to one blip once two entry points are sealed.
