<h1>Rescue</h1>
<p>
As the Space Marines moved into position, a Cyber-Altered
Task spy robot had crept into the hidden depths of the hulk.
Within seconds of connection to the hulk's computer net
the C.A.T. had amassed all the data it required on the
ship's cryogenic systems, both their layout and their
security.
</p>
<p>
The C.A.T. stored the information, disengaged from the net
and began working its way back towards the outer decks.
As soon as the C.A.T. started moving, it was located by the
<i>Intolerance's</i> continuing wide spectra analysis.
</p>
<p>
Contact with the C.A.T. was maintained with relative ease,
but scanners revealed the Genestealers were closing in
rapidly...
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines have retrieved the C.A.T. and must bring it safely back to the boarding craft.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Adorno and Squad Giovan are attempting to return the C.A.T. to the assault boat.
The C.A.T.'s movements are unpredictable, and so it is being carried by the Space Marines.
A Space Marine must carry the C.A.T. off the map at one of the red exit points.
</p>
<p>
A Space Marine may carry the C.A.T with no penalty to movement, fire, or close combat.
Genestealers, however, will ignore it and will not attack it or pick it up.
If a Space Marine is killed, there is a small chance that the C.A.T. will be destroyed. If it survives,
it will fall to the ground and wander off on its own.
A Space Marine may pick up the C.A.T. or take it from a Space Marine in an adjacent square for a cost of 1 action point.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
There are no blips at the beginning of the mission, but three blips
will arrive every turn.
