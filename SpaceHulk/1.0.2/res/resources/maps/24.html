<h1>Capture</h1>
<p>
As the flames died down and the view ahead cleared
Lorenzo could see the charred bodies of the Genestealers
heaped on the floor. The heavy flamer had done its work
well. He ordered the squad to continue its advance, giving
thanks that although the squad had been hastily
assembled from the few Space Marines that had reached
the regrouping area they seemed to have melded into a
team very quickly. As the Terminators waded through the
blackened remains one of the Stealers slowly raised its
head and let loose a terrible cry. Lorenzo blasted it at point
blank range with his storm bolter and the thing dropped
back down onto the pile of its dead brothers.
</p>
<p>
Commander Borgia had ordered all the Space Marines to
pull back to the boarding craft. Sergeant Lorenzo guessed
things were going badly. The boarding force had obviously
suffered severe casualties, and almost all the surviving
Space Marines were wounded. Commander Borgia was a
proud man, not fond of admitting defeat, so the
circumstances must be dire indeed for him to have ordered
a retreat.
</p>
<p>
His comm-link burst into life with a jabber of fresh
instructions. He and his new squad were ordered to turn
back, and rendezvous with Sergeant Vitor and four Space
Marines. Together they were to proceed to a room at
location Beta Kappa 7, and retrieve a vital piece of
electronic equipment that the Techmarines had identified
as a computer archive. If the <b>Blood Angels</b> could save the
archive its value might in some small way compensate for
their failure to capture the hulk.
</p>
<p>
It was an honour to have been chosen to lead such an
important mission, but Sergeant Lorenzo's armour felt very
heavy indeed as he led his men back down into the bowels of
the alien spaceship.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The two squads must collect the hulk's computer
archive which is located in a room in this sector.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must collect the hulk's archive, and carry it out of the sector via one of the red exit points.
</p>
<p>
A Space Marine in the same square as the archive may clamp it to his armour for a cost of 2 action points.
</p>
<p>
The Genestealers cannot move or damage the archive.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
One blip will enter the sector per turn.
</p>
<p>
The Genestealers move first.
