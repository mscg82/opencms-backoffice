<h1>Sabotage</h1>
<p>
Thanks to the selfless heroism of Sergeant Lorenzo, who
suffered such terrible wounds that he almost died, the
hulk's archive had been retrieved. Two of the boarding
craft, laden with wounded Terminators, had already
declamped from the side of the hulk and were slowly
turning back to face the mother ship. The third boarding
craft was barely half full, the Space Marines on board were
waiting for the two last squads. The fourth boarding craft
was dark and empty; it had been left clamped to the space
hulk as a mark of respect for the dead.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Blood Angels</b> had to destroy the space hulk. Such a
thing was too dangerous to leave drifting through space.
Humans, blinded by greed or hungry for forbidden
knowledge might try to raid it. Orks or Chaos raiders might
board the ship and ride it over the seas of the warp. Or the
hulk might be caught by the gravity of a planet and crash
there, spelling the doom of a whole world. If Genestealer
infestation reached too high a level for the Imperium to
suppress, only one option remained: Exterminatus - the
destruction of the entire planet.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Blood Angels'</b> spaceships lacked the firepower to
destroy the hulk, and Commander Borgia could not afford
to wait for the Gothic class battlecruisers of the Imperial
navy. There was one desperate course of action left open to
him, they could try to destroy the hulk by sabotaging its
decrepit nuclear reactors. If the damping controls were
destroyed, the chain reactions within the engines would
tear the hulk apart from the inside. Two squads of <b>Blood
Angels</b> had been slowly working their way towards the
engines and were now within striking distance.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must destroy the reactor
damping controls on the far side of this sector.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must destroy the damping controls. The controls can be destroyed by two storm bolter hits.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Three blips are present at the start of the mission. Two blips will arrive per turn.
</p>
<p>
Note that the Marines may seal the bulkheads at the Genestealer entry points. If only one entry point remains open, then only one reinforcement blip will arrive per turn. If all the entry points are sealed, the reinforcements stop.
</p>
<p>
The Genestealers move first.
