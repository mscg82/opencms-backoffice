<h1>SIN OF DAMNATION</h1>
<p>
The chance sighting of a hulk, apparently inert, and drifting through real
space, was the first since a disastrous <b>Blood Angels</b> engagement over six
hundred years ago. The hulk was spotted by a Rogue Trader who was
exploring the edge of the Segmentum Obscura. Its captain approached the
hulk but, fortunately for the Imperium, decided against a boarding action.
Instead, he returned to human space, and notified Battlefleet Obscura.
</p>
<p>
From the Rogue Trader's data, the vessel was conclusively identified as a
Genestealer-infested space hulk and code-named <i>'Sin of Damnation'</i>. Like
its predecessor, the vessel was still dormant, relying on its near invisibility
to escape detection. Like all hulks, it was a unique combination of
technologies. The ship's origins could span galaxies and hundreds of
millennia. Intact, it could yield enormous value to the Imperium.

Three Gothic class battlecruisers were despatched to investigate - the
<i>Intolerance</i>, the <i>Indestructability</i> and the <i>Righteous Power</i>. As the ships
travelled towards the hulk an astropathic request for help was broadcast,
which was promptly answered by the <b>Blood Angels</b>. Their First Company
was on its way back to Baal, and could easily make a diversion. The <b>Blood
Angels</b> arrived a few hours after the Imperial ships, and the commanders
immediately held a conference on the flagship, <i>Intolerance</i>. It was decided
to attempt a boarding action, and, if this failed, the hulk would be fusion
bombed down to a fine powder by the three Imperial battlecruisers.
