<h1>Cleanse and Burn</h1>
<p>
The Genestealers had launched a massive attack on the
Space Marine defence perimeter. All hell had broken loose.
The fighting was intense, vicious, and bloody. Both sides
fought with fanatical zeal, and total disregard for their own
lives. After the engagement, it was estimated that well over
a thousand Genestealers had been involved in the attack.
</p>
<p>
On the bridge of the <i>Intolerance</i>, the Imperial commanders
watched the battle on the view-screen. Because of the
confined nature of the conflict, it was very difficult to work
out what was going on. The Techmarine worked the
controls, and the view jumped from one location to
another, relayed by the mini-cams in the Terminators'
helmets. The picture jerked about as the Space Marines
moved and fought. Sometimes it burnt out completely
when a storm bolter fired too close. Genestealers hurtled
into view from all directions, their blue bodies darting
backwards and forwards, their claws slashing and ripping.
Tooth-filled jaws gaped wide and snapped at the camera,
spraying it with caustic saliva. Gouts of blue ichor and
sprays of red blood splashed across the camera lens.
</p>
<p>
As the Genestealer attack finally subsided, something
strange was noticed. A group of Space Marines, showing
almost zero life signs, seemed to be moving away from the
perimeter. The Space Marines were alive, although only
just. Although there were as few as thirty Terminators left
on the hulk, Commander Bellisario knew that the Chapter's
gene-seed could not be allowed to fall into enemy hands.
Like it or not, he had no option but to order the captured
Space Marines to be sacrificed. Two squads were ordered
to locate the prisoners, and put them out of their misery.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marine captives are being held in the two
westernmost rooms on the map. To kill the
captives and protect the Chapter's gene-seed, the
Space Marines must 'cleanse' each room by flaming it.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Caristo and Squad Ticinio must cleanse both gene-banks.
A room is cleansed by scoring a flamer hit in the room.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines will fail this mission if both the flamer Marines are killed, or if there
is not sufficient flamer ammunition left to complete the cleansing.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
There are no blips at the beginning of the mission. Two blips 
will arrive every turn.
