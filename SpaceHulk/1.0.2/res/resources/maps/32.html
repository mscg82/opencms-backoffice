<h1>Menace</h1>
<p>
So far, the action to take the space hulk was going well.
Captain Lorenzo had spent decades studying Genestealers
and developing tactics to deal with them. He had a sound
strategy worked out, and the personal experience to back
it up. The <b>Blood Angels'</b> Terminator company was at full
strength, and keen to restore the honour of the Chapter.
The dangers of a space hulk could never be underestimated,
but the <b>Blood Angels</b> were now better prepared
than they had ever been before.
</p>
<p>
Scans of the ship had shown fairly high concentrations of
Genestealers throughout, so Sergeant Gorias was not
surprised by the number of blips showing on his scanner.
The original landing had gone well with no further
casualties after the bridgehead had been established and
now they were to start a push towards the heart of the
hulk, clearing the area as they advanced.

<p>
A brief message over the comm-link from Squad Cleon
informed him they had just encountered heavy resistance,
and could do with assistance. Though the squads did
know where they were in relation to each other, it was
often difficult to meet up. The passages seemed to have no
logical layout, and turned and twisted apparently at
random. The doors would sometimes swing open as they
approached, or could prove so difficult to open that they
had to blow their way through with storm bolter fire.
According to the scanner, Squad Cleon should be directly
ahead of their current position, hopefully through the door
at the end of the passage.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines have five turns to clear the area
before the Genestealers arrive, and then six turns of
Genestealer reinforcements to deal with.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Gorias and Squad Cleon are simply trying to destroy all the Genestealers in this sector.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
This sector is totally overrun with Genestealers. Six reinforcement blips will also arrive, one at a time, after turn 5.
