<h1>Break Through</h1>
<p>
Sergeant Huon checked the scanner again. Seconds ago it
had been clear, now he could see a few green blips at the
edge of the dial. As he watched, more and more blips
appeared, and started moving in to the centre - his
squad's position. The enemy were approaching fast, and
their speed seemed to indicate that they were, after all,
Genestealers. Although the area had been clear when the
squad had emerged from the boarding torpedo, the enemy
had been quick to detect the intruders' presence and move
into contact with them.
</p>
<p>
They had their orders: no matter how heavy the opposition
they must not turn back, as the only chance to get the rest
of the force safely on board the hulk lay in opening the
doors to the cargo bay. A sensor sweep had shown that
the controls for the doors lay in this section of the hulk. It
was hoped that a quick strike by a single squad would not
seem sufficiently threatening to alert the foe. So far the
plan was working and the squad was now close to their
objective, but things were about to get tougher.
</p>
<p>
A final check of the scanner showed that the first of the foe
were nearly upon them, just round the corner ahead. Very
soon they would get their first sight of a Genestealer. With
a terse command he ordered the squad to halt and ready
their weapons. Despite all his years of service, when the
first wave of Stealers tore towards them down the corridor,
Huon nearly froze with horror before his instincts and
training took over. He fired his storm bolter again and
again at the monsters. Behind him, his men fired
continuously, raking the corridor with explosive shells, but
no matter how many Stealers they killed, more flung
themselves forward, screaming with alien fury.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
Sent in by boarding torpedo, Squad Huon makes its way
towards the controls for the cargo bay doors. The controls
are located in the easternmost room on the map.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Huon must reach the computer console and open the cargo bay doors.
</p>
<p>
From the square directly in front of the console any Space Marine may spend 2 action points
to use the console and open the doors. To use the console, the Marine must be facing it, by facing either one of the walls.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Each entry area has one blip at the start of the mission. One reinforcement blip will arrive per turn.
