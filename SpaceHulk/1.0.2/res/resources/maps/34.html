<h1>Isolate</h1>
<p>
Despite heavy opposition, Squads Pesaro and Limbus had
achieved their objective, holding off the Genestealers until
the alien data had been transmitted to the <b>Blood Angels</b>
mother ship. Initial analysis of the data streams showed
that the ship was not the floating hulk the Space Marines
had supposed it to be but was in fact being directed by an
external source based on the planet of Grazarch XXIV in
the nearby Altron star system.
</p>
<p>
Further analysis revealed that the hulk had drifted through
the Altron system some time in the recent past and had
dropped a number of landing pods onto the planet. The
only possible conclusion was that the small Imperial
mining colony on Grazarch had been overrun and that 
someone or something on the planet was directing the
hulk. All attempts to establish communications with
Grazarch failed, but an Astropath on Formund informed the
<b>Blood Angels</b> that all contact with the mining colony had
been lost for three years.
</p>
<p>
Captain Lorenzo knew that he had to deal with this threat.
The alien signal emanating from Grazarch could control
more than just the hulk's movements - it might be able to
activate the ship's weapons systems, force the hulk back
into the warp, or even trigger a self-destruct sequence. The
only way that the threat could be neutralised was to sever
the communication stream before the alien intelligence
could prevent them breaking its control.
</p>
<p>
While the bulk of the Terminator force continued to clear
the hulk of Genestealers, Squads Myran and Catullus were
despatched to destroy the alien receiver.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must get to the communications console and cut off the alien communication link.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squads Myran and Catullus must sever the outside control link to the hulk.
</p>
<p>
A Space Marine must get to the computer console and spend 4 action points to terminate the link.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Four blips are already moving in this sector. One extra blip will arrive every turn.
