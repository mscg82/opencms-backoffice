<h1>Data Download</h1>
<p>
The two squads Pesaro and Limbus were making good
progress through the hulk. So far resistance had been low -
was it possible that the Genestealers hadn't noticed the two
squads? Brother Barino offered a silent prayer to the Emperor
and checked the ammunition on his heavy flamer again.
Sergeant Limbus must have sensed how tense his men were
because his calm voice reassured them over the comm.
</p>
<p>
Their target lay straight ahead, a room which showed high
levels of electrical activity. The Techmarines hoped this
indicated a functioning computer console, and that they could
download the data it contained. Both squads were carrying
data transmitters that could be linked into the hulk's computer
system and would automatically transmit the stolen data to
the <b>Blood Angels</b> mother ship in one short high-speed burst.
</p>
<p>
Such a bold move had never been attempted before, and
showed Captain Lorenzo's confidence. If it worked, the <b>Blood
Angels</b> would have achieved a tremendous coup - the first
ever data download from a hulk's computer archive. The
information it contained would be of incalculable value to the
scientists of the Imperium. The mission was so important that,
if necessary, the Space Marines were expected to sacrifice
themselves so one of them could get to the computer.
</p>
<p>
"Enemy approaching at 12 o'clock! Take your positions and
hold formation!" shouted the Sergeant as five Genestealers
galloped round the corner towards the squad. Barino braced
himself and fired the heavy flamer. Waves of flames rolled
down the corridor and the Genestealers disappeared in a
blazing inferno. The Space Marines had been discovered.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must get information from the computer room.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Pesaro and Squad Limbus are attempting to attach an automatic data transmitter to the hulk's computer.
</p>
<p>
A Space Marine must stand in the target square, facing the wall, and spend 4 action points to attach the transmitter. The mission is successful if the transmitter is attached.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Four blips have converged on this sector. Two more blips will arrive every turn.
</p>
<p>
If the marines can seal off three entry points, the reinforcements will be reduced to one blip per turn. If all the entry points are sealed, the reinforcements stop.
