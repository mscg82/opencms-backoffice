<h1>Exterminate</h1>
<p>
Commander Bellisario paced across the bridge of the
<i>Intolerance</i> to where the Techmarines clustered round the
view screen, studying the layout of the space hulk. The
Space Marines had succeeded in destroying the launch
control room, but at the cost of an entire squad of
Terminators. Bellisario hadn't been alive at the time of the
<b>Blood Angels'</b> first encounter with a space hulk six hundred
years ago, when the First Company had been virtually
wiped out, but he felt the burden of their loss reaching out
to him across the centuries. Now he hoped to avenge their
deaths, and finally lay their souls at peace.
</p>
<p>
The ship's layout had been analysed, and the likely routes
for an alien advance had all been plotted. It was calculated
that the first enemy attacks would be delivered from a
cryogenic cluster a kilometre away from the landing area.
Sealing a key junction along this route should block the
route. A squad of Space Marines had been sent to the
junction, 300 metres beyond the projected perimeter
defences. Here, it was hoped, they could cover the
beachhead area by slowing down the rate of enemy
reinforcement.
</p>
<p>
The advancing Space Marines reached the junction and
spread out to check the nearby rooms for unspotted aliens.
The sweep was finished with only seconds to spare. By the
time the Space Marines reported the area secure, several
hundred Genestealers were converging on their position.
The Terminators were outnumbered by over sixty to one,
and it was obvious that it was only a matter of minutes
before they were wiped out.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marine squad is clearly doomed. It is only
a matter of time before it is destroyed by the
numberless hordes of rampaging Genestealers. The
Space Marines have one overriding desire: to take
out as many Stealers as they can before they go
down.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Cyrano must must kill at least 30 Genestealers before being destroyed.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
There are no blips at the beginning of the mission. Two blips
will arrive every turn. Blips will not lurk, but may not use any entry point
within six floor tiles of any Marine.
