<h1>Defend</h1>
<p>
Once the Genestealers had been drawn off, the last two
squads were able to move into position in the target room.
The toxin had been tested on captured Genestealers, and
had proved effective, but it needed to be administered in a
highly concentrated form to overcome the creatures'
amazing constitution.
</p>
<p>
Because of the large amounts of toxin involved, it would
take several minutes to carry out the contamination. The
tanks were connected to the ducting, and the
contamination process was begun. Immediately the toxic
gas was released into the cryogenic ventilation ducts the
Genestealers sensed and reacted to the danger. All their
active forces began moving towards the duct room...
</p>
<p>
Never had five minutes seemed so long. Commander
Bellisario stared at the glowing green digits on the display
- 1:03... 1:04... 1:05... 1:06... If only Sergeant Darius and his
men could hold the room until the toxic gas was fully
dispersed. All the Stealers in stasis would be killed in one
fell swoop. 3:33... 3:34... 3:35... The screen showed the
view down the corridor leading away from the duct room.
Sergeant Medici and his squad were holding a junction
round the corner. The distant sound of bolter fire reached a
crescendo, there was a terrible scream, then silence. The
picture jumped suddenly as the Space Marine raised his
storm bolter. 3:39... 3:40... Shadows flitted into the end of
the corridor. Instantly, the Space Marine fired his storm
bolter, raking the advancing Genestealers with fire
and thunder.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines must defend the duct room until
all of the toxins have been released into the
cryogenic atmosphere circulation system. If they
keep the Genestealers from destroying the fragile
ducting until the toxins have been released, all of the
hibernating Genestealers will be destroyed as they
awaken. Then all that will be left is the mopping-up
of the several thousand already active Genestealers.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
Squad Darius and Squad Medici must defend the toxin canister in the duct room for 16 turns, while the
toxins disperse into the cryogenic chambers.
</p>
<p>
Because the ducting is fragile, and the toxins highly volatile, flamers may not be used to fire into
or out of the duct room or its entry corridor. If a flamer is fired in this area, the mission is failed.
</p>
<p>
Space Marines may begin the mission placed anywhere on the map, in any facing.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Two blips have already arrived. Two more will arrive each turn.
