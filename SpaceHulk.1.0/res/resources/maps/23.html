<h1>Regroup</h1>
<p>
Sergeant Machiavel fired again and finally the Genestealer
went down. Quickly he swung around to the right and
snapped off a shot at another monster as it bounded
towards him. The shot hit his second target in the neck,
blowing its head from its body and ichor sprayed the
corridor as yet another alien died. There seemed to be
thousands of them and they still kept coming. These
Genestealers were a foe like no other he had ever fought,
incredibly hard to kill. His armour already bore a triple
gouge from the claw of a Genestealer that seemed to keep
coming through the unrelenting hail of his overwatch
before he cut it down with his power sword.
</p>
<p>
Seconds earlier, Brother Deino had been caught at an
intersection by Genestealers coming at him from two
directions. Even his heavy flamer had not been enough to
protect him. Thankfully they now had another heavy flamer
since Squad Leon had linked up with them after the death
of their Sergeant, but they had lost another Space Marine
since. Shooting in both directions up and down the
corridor, no-one had noticed the two Stealers running
upside down along the ceiling until it was too late. They
had dropped down on Brother Altair's head and had torn
his armour open and disembowelled him before being
blown apart themselves in a storm of vengeful storm bolter
fire from the other Space Marines.

<p>
Sergeant Machiavel turned back to the right. His scanner
showed further blips approaching just as his
communicator came alive again. The other units were also
suffering heavy casualties, many squads had been lost,
while the number of Genestealers seemed infinite. The
Captain had finally been forced to accept that the hulk
could not be cleared by such a small force, and was
pulling the units back together. With a feeling of relief
Machiavel told his tired men they were pulling back.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
The mission follows the remains of Squads
Machiavel and Leon as they head off to regroup with
the rest of the force.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
The Space Marines are trying to reach the regrouping area, but their route has taken them into
a section of the hulk not previously cleared.
</p>
<p>
At least three Marines must make it through this sector and out the red exit points. If at least one Marine escapes, the mission can be considered a draw.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
Two blips are already present in the sector. Two blips will arrive per turn for the first eight turns.
