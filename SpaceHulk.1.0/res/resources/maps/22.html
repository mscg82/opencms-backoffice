<h1>Forge Ahead</h1>
<p>
All of the Space Marines had seen the pictures of the
Genestealers sent back by the cameras of Squad Huon and
there was no denying how deadly they were. Storm bolter
fire could kill them, and heavy flamers were particularly
effective, but in close combat the sheer strength and
ferocity of a Genestealer was more than a match for even a
Terminator-armoured Space Marine warrior.
</p>
<p>
They watched with Sergeant Huon as the Stealers ripped
through a solid steel door in seconds, tearing it apart with
great slashes of their claws before forcing their bodies
through the rents and leaping at Brother Marias. Point
blank storm bolter blew the first two back into the door,
the third Stealer dodged the worst of the blast and latched
its teeth into Brother Marias' power fist, champing through
his armour. A fourth Stealer squeezed through the door
and hurled itself straight at Brother Marias' head, bearing
the Marine backwards down onto the floor with a mighty
crash. With two snaps of its teeth it smashed through his
helmet and tore off his head in a spray of blood.
</p>
<p>
How many Stealers were on the hulk? The <b>Blood Angels</b>
had no way of telling. They must continue their
reconnaissance. The terrible death of Brother Marias made
Commander Borgia even more determined to destroy the
Genestealers and seize the hulk. Working to the original'
plan, he split his force into smaller units and sent them
into the hulk. The opposition would be fierce, but this was
no time for subtlety: courage, firepower and faith would
prevail. Some Brothers would fall, but ultimately they
would emerge triumphant. Of their victory, Borgia was
assured.
</p>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
This particular mission shows Squad Josefas and
Squad Pietr clearing a section of the hulk. They have
a target of 25 Genestealers to kill before they move
on to another section.
</p>

<h1>Space Marine Objectives</h1>
<p>
The combined squads must kill at least 25 Genestealers. Once this is acheived, a red exit point will appear
to the north of this sector. 
</p>
<p>
At least four Marines must escape for the mission to be considered a success.
If at least one Marine escapes, but less than four, the result is a draw.
</p>
<p>
The Space Marines move first.
</p>

<h1>Opposition Forces</h1>
<p>
This sector is already crawling with Genestealers. Each room starts with one blip, and one new blip will arrive each turn.
</p>
<p>
Blips can only be forced to lurk in an entry area for one turn.
